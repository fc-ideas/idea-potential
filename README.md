# idea-potential
We propose a framework to evaluate research paradigms by their generative potential: how many high-quality ideas they can produce via composable transformations. Ideas are objects, methods are functors, humans are first-class. Successful paradigms expose abstraction, composability, scaling, and human steerability.
